## About this proyect
In this proyect you are going to see the develpment of a web sistem that facilitates the recording of hours worked by each employee in each project and work team. We designed upon request a company named Trackgenix SA, a software development company. Previusly we designed this page usign Figma.
## Week-02 Structure of the HTML
I started the index using the basic html:5 structure. Starting with the body I decided to created the sidebar, then I cointinued with the main content which I split in 5 sections for a better order and view of the document, and by the end you are going to find the footer with it's respective copyright.
### Assets folder
In this repository you are also going to find an asset folder that contaign all the images that I use in the file.
## Week-03 CSS styles
This week I gave styles to the HTML work of week-02. I did this by creating and linking an external stylesheet named style.css to a copy of the previus HTML index.
