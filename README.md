# BaSP-M2022-Etapa-1
Hi! My name is Ivan Gobbi and i'm currently doing Became a Software Professional course by Radium Rocket.
## About this proyect
In this proyect you are going to see the develpment of a web sistem that facilitates the recording of hours worked by each employee in each project and work team. We designed upon request a company named Trackgenix SA, a software development company. Previusly we designed this page usign Figma.
### Assets folder
In this repository you are also going to find an asset folder in each folder that requieres it, that contaign all the images that I use in each proyect.
## Week-02 Structure of the HTML
I started the index using the basic html:5 structure. Starting with the body I decided to created the sidebar, then I cointinued with the main content which I split in 5 sections for a better order and view of the document, and by the end you are going to find the footer with it's respective copyright.
## Week-03 CSS styles
This week I gave styles to the HTML work of week-02. I did this by creating and linking an external stylesheet named style.css to a copy of the previus HTML index. 
## Week-04 FlexBox
In the assignment of this week the goal was to recreate the same landing page of the previus works, but using flexbox. My main goal was to make the page perfectly responsive for all resolutions and devices, like cellphones, tablets and monitors.
I started by planning how I was going to organize the screen and reorganize the html file for better results. Once the layout is finished, I continue arranging all the elements in their correct place. Once is all placed I added the corresponding styles and visual effects. Then I finished by correcting the responsive settings for a better display of the entire screen in each resolution.

You can check the result in the following link of my github page:
